# mcp_server_s3_download_files
This repository provides an implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AWS S3, enabling AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to securely interact with S3 buckets. The server offers a standardized interface to list S3 buckets, list objects within buckets, and download file contents.
